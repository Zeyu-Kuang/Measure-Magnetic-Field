# Measure Magnetic Field
## Background
We are trying to find putative violation to Lorentz invariance in phonon section. 
We build a rotating table with two phonon oscillators on top. 
We read the frequency difference between two phonon oscillators and determine the possible violation coefficients, using 'Rotational Data Analysis program'.

## Motivation
A potential limit of the current experiment is the magnetic field in the laboratory. 
To improve the precision of our measurement, we need to shell and monitor the magnetic field in the laboratory.

This program is developed intended to measure the magnetic field using a magnetometer through either a Multimeter or a Vecter Signal Analyser.
